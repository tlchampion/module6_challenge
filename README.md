# Module 6 Challenge

This is the Module 6 Challenge for the FinTech Bootcamp.




---

## Technologies

All code is contained within the included jupyter lab notebook. 

Python version 3.9.15 was used to complete this challenge. 

---

## Installation Guide

A working python environment is required. The included environmnet.yml file can be used to create a conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

```


Alternatively, an existing environment can be used in which case both Jupyter Lab and python-dotenv must be installed along with watermark. If now already done, both may be installed using pip

```
pip install jupyterlab
pip install python-dotenv
pip install watermark

```




---

## Usage

The included .ipynb file should be opened in Jupyter Lab, which can be started in the configured python environment

```
jupyter lab

```

Details on using Jupyter Lab are beyond the scope of this project. Please consult the [Jupyter Lab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) for usage details.
