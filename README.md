## Installation Guide

A working python environment is required. The included environmnet.yml file can be used to create a conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

```


Alternatively, an existing environment can be used in which case Jupyter Lab, pandas, hvplot and geoviews must be installed. If not already done, they may be installed using pip

```
pip install jupyterlab
pip install pandas
pip install hvplot
pip install geoviews

```

## Usage

The included .ipynb file should be opened in Jupyter Lab, which can be started in the configured python environment

```
jupyter lab

```

Details on using Jupyter Lab are beyond the scope of this project. Please consult the [Jupyter Lab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) for usage details.
